# Bunny Quest
> A Platform game made with the Phaser 3 framework

The goal is for the bunny to grab as many carrots as possible without falling off the platforms, the bunny is limited to two jumps per time.
The platforms disappear as soon as it is no longer in sight, so making the right move is important.

The game is over once the bunny falls off the platform.
Scores increase by 10 once you grab a carrot.
